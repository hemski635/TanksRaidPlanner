# RaidPlanner - WoW Addon

⚠️ **DISCLAIMER: THIS IS A JOKE ADDON AND COMPLETELY UNTESTED AI SLOP** ⚠️

**Do NOT use this addon in actual raids. It will likely break, crash, or give you completely wrong information at critical moments.**

## What Is This?

A World of Warcraft addon that dynamically displays raid difficulty recommendations based on:
- Whether your raid is a full guild run
- How late the raid started
- Boss progression

## Features (Theoretical)

- ✅ Automatically detects raid roster composition
- ✅ Tracks raid start time
- ✅ Suggests HEROIC difficulty if conditions are optimal
- ✅ Falls back to NORMAL if conditions are suboptimal
- ✅ Updates in real-time as bosses are defeated
- ✅ Displays recommendations in a movable UI window
- ✅ Includes slash command support

## Known Issues

- ❌ **NEVER TESTED IN ACTUAL RAIDS**
- ❌ Encounter detection may not work
- ❌ Raid roster API calls might be outdated
- ❌ UI might not render properly
- ❌ Event handlers might not fire
- ❌ Guild detection logic is oversimplified
- ❌ No error handling whatsoever
- ❌ Probably incompatible with current WoW patch
- ❌ Will absolutely break things™

## Installation (For Testing Only)

1. Create a folder named `RaidPlanner` in your `World of Warcraft\_retail_\Interface\AddOns\` directory
2. Copy all files into that folder
3. Enable the addon in-game
4. Type `/raidplan` to toggle the UI
5. Watch in horror as it malfunctions

## Usage

```
/raidplan         - Toggle the UI window
/raidplan reset   - Reset raid start time
```

## Commands Expected to Fail

All of them.

## Why Does This Exist?

This addon was created as a **joke** to automate a raid leader's planning logic from World of Warcraft guild raids. It's a proof-of-concept that should never see production use.

## Technical Debt

- No error handling
- Hardcoded boss encounter IDs
- Magic numbers everywhere
- Comments that lie
- No unit tests
- No validation
- Memory leaks (probably)
- Spaghetti code
- API calls that may not exist

## License

UNLICENSE - Do whatever you want with it, but don't blame me when it explodes.

## Changelog

### v1.0 (Never Released)
- Initial commit: Zero testing, maximum chaos

## Special Thanks

🙏 **Special thanks to Tank** for providing the hilariously unclear raid plan that required advanced AI technology to decipher into something resembling code. Without their cryptic message, this addon would never have existed.

**Last Warning:** This addon is a meme. Do not use it. Seriously. It will ruin your raid night.
