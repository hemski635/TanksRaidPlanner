## DO NOT CONTRIBUTE

This is a joke addon. Contributions that attempt to make it functional are not welcome.

If you must submit a PR:
1. Include a test case proving it makes things worse
2. Add comments explaining why you broke it further
3. Update the WARNINGS.md to include your new failure mode

## Code Style

There is none. Maintain maximum chaos.

## Testing

Do not test. Testing defeats the purpose.

## Questions?

Don't ask. You won't get a helpful answer.
